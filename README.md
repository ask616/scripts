# scripts
A collection of assorted scripts I've used over the years.

`docker_backup.py`: Uses [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to back up the docker services I run on my personal server and SendGrid to email me reports.

`docker_recovery.py` Uses rclone to recover the most recent backup into my server.

`164_autograder.py`: The autograder script I used to grade projects for Berkeley's [CS 164 Spring 2018](https://sites.google.com/site/cs164fall2018/)
